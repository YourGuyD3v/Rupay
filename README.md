## Overview

**Rupay Protocol** is a decentralized and overcollateralized stablecoin system that powers **RUP**, a digital asset pegged to the U.S. Dollar (USD).  
It is designed to offer price stability without relying on centralized entities, using on-chain collateral and algorithmic mechanisms to maintain the peg.

Rupay enables users to mint RUP by locking up supported crypto assets such as **ETH**, **BTC**, and other exogenous collaterals.  
Through overcollateralization and liquidation safeguards, the system ensures solvency and resilience even during extreme market volatility.

### üîπ Core Principles

- **Pegged to USD:** 1 RUP ‚âà $1, maintained via collateral-backed stability.  
- **Decentralized:** Governed by smart contracts, free from centralized control.  
- **Exogenous Collateral:** Backed by external crypto assets like ETH and BTC, ensuring transparency and verifiable value.  
- **Overcollateralized:** Each RUP is backed by more than its equivalent value in collateral (minimum ratio: **200%**).  
- **Robust Stability Mechanism:** Automated minting, redemption, and liquidation keep the peg balanced and the system solvent.

In essence, Rupay Protocol combines the security of crypto-backed reserves with the stability of fiat-pegged assets ‚Äî offering a **trustless, transparent, and decentralized stablecoin** for the next generation of DeFi.
